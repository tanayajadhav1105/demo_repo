Hello, I'm actor Hong Soo Hyun.

I've been living with my parents for 34 years.

Until several days ago, I am now living with new family members.

5
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm half worried, half excited?

10
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,220
The awkwardness was just for a moment 

11
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,289
and it seemed like welcoming each other was a lot bigger.

made even though he couldn't eat spicy foods.

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,219
I think I've moved up a level and matured.
